I am a Research Associate at the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University in May 2021, under the supervision of Professor William Meeker and Professor Daniel Nordman.

I will be joining the University of Waterloo as an assitant professor in fall 2020.
